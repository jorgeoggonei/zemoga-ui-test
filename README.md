## Comments

Due to time, I didn't can complete all the test. My apologize for that.

The JSON file structure was created by the rulings.

I used React, sass, axios in my development

In the previous rulings section , the thumb in the left side of the person's name doesn't appear if the votes have the same number in positive and negative.

Thanks for the opportunity.
